                <p className='text-xl'><span className='font-bold'>Ans: </span>JavaScript is a basic programming language that may be executed in any browser that supports the JavaScript Engine. Whereas Node JS is an interpreter or execution environment for the JavaScript programming language, it requires libraries that can be readily accessible from JavaScript programming for better utilization.</p>

                <p className='text-xl'><span className='font-bold'>Ans: </span>SQL databases scale vertically, but NoSQL databases scale horizontally. NoSQL databases are document, key-value, graph, or wide-column stores, whereas SQL databases are table-based. SQL databases are better suited for multi-row transactions, but NoSQL databases are better suited for unstructured data such as documents or JSON.</p>

                <p className='text-xl'><span className='font-bold'>Ans: </span>JWT, or JSON Web Token, is an open standard for exchanging security information between two parties - a client and a server. Each JWT comprises encoded JSON objects containing a set of claims. JWTs are signed with a cryptographic technique to ensure that the claims cannot change after issuing the token.</p>
